# Maintenance-auto-

This is for Windows only
========================
Tired of running disk check and cleaning out temp folders and seeing those crazy files that should be hidden? Then compile this, add the entries in the App.config file and set it to run daily in task scheduler.

Also please note that the App.config file is renamed to: MainExecutablesName.exe.config eg. Maintenance.exe.config
